# Houschef

A virtual cooking assistant made for Android that allows the user to search up and favorite recipes from 
the internet. Recipes found through the internet are parsed to be split into an ingredients and steps list for the 
application to read out to the user. Users can use their voice to navigate forward and backwards through the 
recipe and request specific information such as the temperature, time, and ingredients of a specific step. The 
purpose of this application is to provide an easier cooking experience for users while they are trying to follow a 
recipe by reducing the need to touch their phones to view specific information about a recipe and allowing them 
to use their voice instead.
